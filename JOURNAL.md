# August 22nd: Basic plan

**Time: 1h**

(I'm journalling this retrospectively) I originally intended for this to be a rp2040 devboard, hence I started with that an began looking through some resources 
(mainly the rp2040 [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and [design](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf) documents. This was researching session.

# August 31st: Back to work

**Time: 1.5h**

Had some personal stuff but now we're back and better than ever. I finalized my idea to basically be a version of the sprig, as there are already firmare and hundreds of pre-coded games!
The schematic is still quite lacking and there are a lot more specificities I need to figure out so that the sprig games will run on this. Some differences is I will be using 4.5 via 3 x AAA batteries and potentially have a larger display (not sure about this one).

My hierachial pages are still empty and the I haven't quite figured out how I want to flash this.

# September 5th: 

**Time: 0.5h**

I've been a bit busy so I haven't taken any screenshots or journalled properly, so I'm just writing this in bulk.

I ended up switching to using a RT615BGQW (the pi pico uses the 3.3v version) and it'll provide 800mA which should be enough. 

# September 6th: 

**Time: 2h**


I finsihed the schematic and tomorrow I hope to finish the pcb completely. Also, I've begun tracking my kicad time again! (I switched to linux a bit ago and didn't bother to get the kicad-wakatime plugin oops)
