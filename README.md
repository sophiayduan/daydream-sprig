# Daydream-Sprig

#### A version of the [Sprig](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig) without a pi pico and made to be a lanyard for [Daydream Ottawa](https://daydream.hackclub.com/ottawa) organizers.

Spade, the Sprig OS, and all Sprig games should be able to run on it. It features a RP2040, ST7735 1.8" Display, 6mm x 6mm push buttons.


(unlike the original sprig, this board doesn't include a speaker due to its cost)
