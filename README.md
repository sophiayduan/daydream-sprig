I'll be setting it up the same as the Sprig. flashing Spade OS (Sprigs custom operating system)

### Features 
- All pre-exsiting sprig stuff (Rp2040, ST7735 1.8" Display, powered via 2xaaa, etc)
- 6x6mm push buttons
- Vertical handheld form factor
- 4 additional GPIOS
- Cool silkscreen art made by Erin + stolen from the og sprig


(unlike the original sprig, this board doesn't include a speaker due to its cost)

This project was made as a lanyard for [Daydream Ottawa](https://daydream.hackclub.com/ottawa) organizers, I didn't end up finishing it in time oops.
